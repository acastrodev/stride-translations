# Importing resources

In this tutorial, we will learn how to import resources into Stride game studio using two different methods:

- Creating an asset via the Asset View, or
- Dragging and dropping files directly from a folder

We also learn how important it is that we keep our resources in a projects resources folder, rather than having them scattered across our computer.
