# Navigation

This C# Intermediate tutorial covers the basics of the navigation system in Stride.

## Explanation

In our world we can have so called 'navigation meshes'. These are meshes that are generated around your level geometry. The navigation mesh is used to calculate the quickest path to a destination.

We learn about the editors Navigation mesh settings, navigation bounding boxes and in code we learn how to move an object to a destination using the Navigation component that comes with the Stride engine.
